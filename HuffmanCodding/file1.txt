Many people argue that sports, where there are animals should be forbidden. Animal defenders often oppose these events, but many such competitions are held annually in civilized countries despite this. Let us consider the advantages and disadvantages of a similar kind of sport.
One argument in support of competitions with the participation of animals is a lot of scandals around sports where people participate. There are tired of the constant doping revelations and the huge attention of the press to this. Furthermore, sports with the participation of animals contribute to the preservation of their pedigree qualities. For instance, many dog breeds have already turned into decorative. Because of what they have a lot of health problems.
But there are also many arguments against it. Firstly, animals are often treated cruelly. For example, the Kok-Boru competition at the Moscow Hippodrome caused a lot of controversies. The competition was a huge success, the stadium was filled, but the horses were seriously injured. The bridles tore some horses' mouths. Other animals were injured because of collisions with each other or falling. Secondly, these sports are harmful to the environment. Some animals are released into the fauna in which they should not be. This has a negative impact on the environment.
In conclusion, sports with animals have a significant place in our society, but also negatively affect nature. Perhaps we should take care of the animals themselves first of all, rather than our own entertainment. Thus, the exclusion of such a sport is not such a bad idea.
